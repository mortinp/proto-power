### Summary ###

Welcome! This project attempts to achieve a user-friendly file-uploading experience over the web.
It's built as a Javascript plugin for developers looking to incorporate file-uploading into their website.

This plugin uses an XMLHttpRequest (AJAX) for uploading multiple files with a progress-bar in
FF3.6+, Safari4+, Chrome and falls back to hidden-iframe-based upload in other browsers (namely IE),
providing good user experience everywhere.

It does not use Flash, jQuery, or any external libraries.

Take a look at the new evolving [Demo](http://fineuploader.com) page.

### Releases/Downloads ###
**You can [download released versions](https://github.com/valums/file-uploader/wiki/Releases), or, if you are more daring,
use the snapshot version on the master branch.**  


<br/>
### Upgrading from Fine Uploader 2.0 ###
You can see all bugs and features tackled in the 2.1 release [here](https://github.com/valums/file-uploader/issues?milestone=2&page=1&state=closed).
If you are only interested in a summary, here are some of the more notable changes:

<br/>
###### Features/Enhancements ######
* Added option to allow all valid files to upload, skipping only invalid files
* Added gradually filling progress bar (for browsers that support XHR upload/file API)
* The `onError` callback is now called whenever _any_ error occurs, either with the upload or file submission
* An `error` JSON property in the response is used to determine the specific failure reason, `reason` property no longer supported
* Ability to force all requests to use multipart encoding is now a bit more straightforward.  Added a `forceMultipart` option.
* Added ability to determine if dropzones are hidden or not via the `hideDropzones` options
* Added ability to hide default dropzone via the `disableDefaultDropzone` option
* Option to display dynamic custom error text next to each failed upload.  See the `failedUploadTextDisplay` option documentation for more details.

###### Bug Fixes ######
Please see the list of issues [here](https://github.com/valums/file-uploader/issues?labels=bug&milestone=2&page=1&state=closed).


<br/>
### Features ###
* Multiple file select, progress-bar in FF, Chrome, Safari
* Drag-and-drop file select in FF, Chrome
* Uploads are cancelable
* No external dependencies
* Doesn't use Flash
* Fully working with HTTPS
* Keyboard support in FF, Chrome, Safari
* Tested in IE7+ (not IE10 yet), Firefox, Safari (OS X), and Chrome.  Safari for Windows is not supported, nor is IE6 or earlier.

<br/>
### Getting started ###
The `fileuploader.js` contains two classes that are meant to be used directly.
If you need a complete upload widget (from demo) to quickly drop
into your current design, use `qq.FileUploader`.

If you want to customize uploader, by using a different looking file list
or change the behaviour or functionality use `qq.FileUploaderBasic`.

The difference between them is that `qq.FileUploader` provides a list of files,
drag-and-drop, but `qq.FileUploaderBasic` only creates button and handles validation.
Basic uploader is easier extendable, and doesn't limit possible customization.

`qq.FileUploader` extends `qq.FileUploaderBasic`, so that all the options present
in the basic uploader also exist in the full widget.


<br/>
### qq.FileUploader - Setting up full upload widget ###
Include `fileuploader.js` and `fileuploader.css` into your page.
Create container element.

```html
<div id="file-uploader">
<noscript>
    <p>Please enable JavaScript to use file uploader.</p>
    <!-- or put a simple form for upload here -->
</noscript>
</div>
```

Initialize uploader when the DOM is ready. Change the action option.
For example ../server/php.php for the default folder structure.
In the server folder you will find examples for different platforms.
If you can't find the one you need, check the readme.txt in the same folder.

```javascript
var uploader = new qq.FileUploader({
	// pass the dom node (ex. $(selector)[0] for jQuery users)
	element: document.getElementById('file-uploader'),
	// path to server-side upload script
	action: '/server/upload'
});
```

<br/>

            seen if the default <code>showMessage</code> implementation is not overriden.  In this case, an alert 
            dialog will appear for each invalid file in the batch, and the upload process will not continue until 
            the dialog is dismissed.  If this is bothersome, simply override <code>showMessage</code> with a 
            desirable implementation.  3.0 will likely have a <code>showMessage</code> default implementation that 
            does not use the <code>alert</code> function.</td>

            <code>enableTooltip:</code>: If set to true, a tooltip will display the full contents of the error message when the mouse pointer
            hovers over the failed file.  Note that this currently uses the title attribute of the failed file element, but there is an issue
            to improve this (see #355 for details).</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<br/>
### Styling FileUploader ###
The `template` option contains default elements with default classes that make up the uploader as a whole in the DOM.  For example,
the first default element in `template` is a `div` with a class of `qq-uploader`.  This is the parent element of the uploader.
The default drop area, button, and file list elements are also, by default, contained in this option.  You can use this option to
add additional elements, modify default template elements, etc.

There is also a `fileTemplate` option which contains default elements that make up one file item in the file list.

Finally, a `classes` option allows you to change the default class names for these elements.  Be sure the values in `classes`
match the class names used in the corresponding template elements (where appropriate).

<br/>
### Callbacks (FileUploader & FileUploaderBasic) ###
* `onSubmit(String id, String fileName)` - called when the file is submitted to the uploader portion of the code.
Note that this does not mean the file upload will begin at this point.  Return `false` to prevent submission to the uploader.
* `onComplete(String id, String fileName, Object responseJSON)` - called when the file upload has finished.
* `onCancel(String id, String fileName)` - called when the file upload has been cancelled.
* `onUpload(String id, String fileName)` - called just before the file upload begins
* `onProgress(String id, String fileName, int uploadedBytes, int totalBytes)` - called during the upload, as it progresses.  Only used by the XHR/ajax uploader.
* `onError(String id, String fileName, String errorReason)` - called whenever an exceptional condition occurs (during an upload, file selection, etc).

<br/>
### Changing alert/messages to something more user friendly ###
You may want to change the default alert implementation and messages as you see fit.  This is possible by overriding the
`showMessage` function option, as well as the `messages` properties in FileUploaderBasic and the `extraMessages` properties
in FileUploader.  The default `showMessage` function simply invokes `alert` with the message text.  One instance in which t
his is used is when the user attempts to select an invalid file for upload.  There are general message
types with default text that can be overriden as well.

<br/>
### Instance methods ###
* `setParams(Object newParams)` - Set the parameters sent along with the request after initializing the uploader.  It can be nicely used in `onSubmit` callback.
* `uploadStoredFiles()` - If `!autoUpload`, this will begin uploading all queued files.
* `clearStoredFiles()` - Clears the internal list of stored files.  Only applicable when `autoUpload` is set to false.
* `getInProgress()` - Returns the number of files that are either currently uploading or files waiting in line for upload.

<br/>
### Internet Explorer Limitations ###
IE continues to lag _far_ behind all other browsers in terms of features.  IE10 is supposed to, finally, start to compete
with existing modern browsers.  For those of you with customers suffering with IE9 and older, here are some of the limitations
you may want to be aware of when using Fine Uploader:

    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Can't parse JSON response if response code is not 200</td>
            <td>If the response code is not 200, and the size of the response is less than 512, or, apparently, sometimes, less
            than 256 bytes, IE replaces the response with a "friendly" error message.  If you insist on returning responses
            with a status code other than 200, you can work around this by instructing IE users to uncheck the "show friendly
            HTTP error messages" setting.</td>

            in IE.  The content-size for multipart data requests does not refer only to the file.  Rather, it refers to the
            the total size of all sections in the request.</td>

            include it.  There may be a way to make this work, but I haven't spent time playing around with the
            available options yet.  In the meantime, you should probably set the <code>disableCancelForFormUploads</code>
            option to true.  If I can't find a way to properly allow cancel to work when using the form uploader, I'll
            probably remove the cancel link when the form uploader is in use.</td>

### Troubleshooting ###
If you can't get the uploader to work, please try the following steps
before asking for help.

If the upload doesn't complete, saying "failed":

* Set the `debug` option of the FileUploader to true.
* Open the page where you have a FileUploader.
* Open developer console in your browser.
* Try to upload the file. You should see a server response.

It should be `{"success":true}` for completed requests. If it's not,
then you have a problem with your server-side script.
